                    Airport taxes depend on the selected airline company, the
                    flight route and the airports at which transfers must be
                    made during a flight. Airline companies and other third
                    parties also impose security and/or fuel surcharges.

                    Airline companies may apply surcharges for check-in baggage.
                    The surcharges apply to individual baggage items and differ
                    per airline company. Any surcharges will be displayed during
                    the booking process. In addition, airline companies may
                    apply surcharges for services such as on-board refreshments
                    and checking in at the airport instead of online. The
                    airline company may also charge additional costs for meals
                    and meal preferences, or preferred seats. Travellers are
                    responsible for obtaining information on additional
                    surcharges applied by the airline company.

                  requires you to be aware of the fact that vaccinations and/or
                  malaria tablets are necessary for a large number of foreign
                  destinations. If you have not had particular vaccinations, you
                  may be denied access to a country. Vaccinations may also be
                  required in the event of a short stay, such as a transfer.
                  Various authorities can inform you about the risks of diseases
                  in (sub-)tropical countries and the available vaccinations
                  against those diseases.{" "}

                  If you are travelling to or transiting the USA, and want to
                  make use of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), you must ask for
                  permission to use the Electronic System for Travel
                  Authorization (ESTA). You should do so as soon as you have
                  booked an Airline Ticket and/or hotel, and no later than 72
                  hours before departure. After that, you can still apply for
                  ESTA travel permission, but if permission is refused, you may
                  not have enough time to apply for the required visas.

                  It is the Traveller’s responsibility to check in with the
                  relevant airline company in time. A number of airline
                  companies offer a pre-departure online check-in facility via
                  the website. We recommend that you consult the website of your
                  airline company, in order to see whether that type of facility
                  is available for the flight(s) you have booked. In the case of
                  a number of airline companies, checking in online is actually
                  compulsory. For the latest information, we recommend
                  contacting your airline company.

                  An Airline Ticket consists of one or more coupons. Each of
                  these relates to one part of the journey, as stated on the
                  itinerary. The tariff paid by the Customer corresponds to the
                  itinerary as stated on the Airline Ticket. The use of the
                  entire itinerary stated on the Airline Ticket forms an
                  essential part of the contract of carriage between the
                  Customer and the airline company. The Traveller is required to
                  adhere to the travel route stated on the booking. The
                  cancellation or non-use of individual coupons of the trip is
                  not permitted. An Airline Ticket will not be accepted if one
                  or more coupons are not used in the order in which the coupons
                  were issued, starting with the place of departure as stated on
                  the Airline Ticket. If the Traveller fails to turn up for one
                  of the flights, Airline Companies will regard the Traveller as
                  a "no show", which will cause his/her onward flights to be
                  cancelled, without any compensation being payable. If you have
                  booked a flight from Dusseldorf, via Amsterdam to New York,
                  you cannot therefore join the flight in Amsterdam.
